Today I thought of making a little game. So I created a Rock Paper Scissors Game using Python. Although we play it with each other in real life, it also brings a lot of weird fun to the digital world. It's so much fun. Play and have fun too ðŸ˜‡ðŸš€.

First, enter the number of rounds to be played and click on the "Start Game" button. Then you click on your first choice from Rock, Paper, and Scissors. Then play until you complete the number of rounds.
